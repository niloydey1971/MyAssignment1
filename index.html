          <h1>About Call of Duty&#174</h1>
          <p>
            Call of Duty, electronic game that brought new advances to the first-person shooter genre, winning numerous game of the year awards in 2003 and 2004 following its 2003 debut. Designed by the American company Infinity Ward and produced by <span style="color: blue;">Activision</span>, Call of Duty used World War II as a setting, allowing players to see the war through the eyes of American, Soviet, and British soldiers. <br>Call of Duty combined challenging single-player missions with a multiplayer engine that breathed new life into a genre spawned by such gaming greats as Doom and Quake. Call of Duty allowed players to advance through World War II in a series of campaigns or to battle it out against human opponents in its multiplayer mode. Solo play featured a cast of computer-controlled allies to better simulate actual war, during which a soldier would have been part of a large group rather than always fighting alone. The ability to pull up and aim firearms, to relive the last few seconds of a fallen comrade’s life, and to realistically be stunned by nearby explosions were notable features that helped distance the game from its competitors.

              <h2>Call of Duty&#174: Warzone</h2>
              <p class="description">
                Call of Duty: Warzone is a free-to-play battle royale video game released on March 10, 2020, for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. A version for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S has been announced to be released sometime in the future.[1] The game is a part of 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and is connected to 2020's Call of Duty: Black Ops: Cold War and 2021's Call of Duty: Vanguard (but does not require purchase of either titles) and was introduced during Season 2 of Modern Warfare content. Warzone is developed by Infinity Ward and Raven Software (the latter later credited as the sole developer following the integration of Cold War's content) and published by Activision. Warzone allows online multiplayer combat among 150 players, although some limited-time game modes support 200 players. Other modes include Plunder, Rebirth Resurgence, Buy Back Solos and others. The game features both cross-platform play and cross-platform progression between three games.

                The game features two main modes: Battle Royale and Plunder. Warzone introduces a new in-game currency system that can be used at "Buy Stations" in and around the map. "Loadout" drops are an example of where Cash can be traded for limited access to players' custom classes (which were shared with Modern Warfare's standard modes prior to Season 6, v1.29, but now are unique to Warzone). Players may also use Cash to purchase items such as "killstreaks" and gas masks. Cash can be found by looting buildings and killing players that have cash on them. At launch, Warzone only offered Trios, a squad capacity of three players. However, in free post-launch content updates, Solos, Duos and Quads have all been added to the game.

                Infinite Warfare delivers three unique game modes: Campaign returns to the gritty, large-scale war roots of the franchise, while boldly looking ahead. Multiplayer delivers the future of warfare, with many new gameplay innovations. And the cooperative Zombies mode takes players on a wild ride through a new storyline with unique gameplay features and mechanics.<br> Call of Duty: Mobile was announced in March 2019, with TiMi-J3, itself a TiMi Studio Group division, which is a subsidiary of Tencent Games, leading development. Many of the game's features were revealed at this announcement, promising a familiar experience for fans of the console games. The aim of the game was to take familiar aspects from the franchise's previous games and allow users to access them from their mobile devices. It features two in-game currencies, as well as a battle pass. The initial release was in Australia on June 15, 2019, following the soft-launches in Australia, Canada and Peru. Garena released the game in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan & Thailand on September 29, 2019. The game was released in Europe, North America and Latin America by Activision on September 30, 2019, and by Tencent Games in South Korea on October 1, 2019.

                Call of Duty: Mobile features many playable characters, maps, and game modes from previous games in the series. Different control settings were included to cater to player's preferences.[26] A "zombies" game mode was added to the game in November 2019. This game mode followed the classic Call of Duty zombies "survival" formula where the player fights off endless waves of zombies, aiming to survive as long as possible. A "Raid" mode was also included where the player had to defeat a set amount of waves of zombies before encountering one of two final bosses. Call of Duty: Mobile Zombies mode was removed on March 25, 2020, due to the game mode not meeting Activision's standards.</div>
